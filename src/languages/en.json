This method not only improves the accuracy of forecasts for wildfires, droughts, floods and landslides, but also optimizes how resources are allocated for risk reduction. Integrating meteorological, geochemical and topographic data enables early warning systems to help local authorities and civil‐protection agencies anticipate extreme events, plan evacuations and reinforce critical infrastructure in advance."
